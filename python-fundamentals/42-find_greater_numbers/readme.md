Write a function called find_greater_numbers which accepts a list and returns the number of times a number is followed by a larger number.

Examples

```py
find_greater_numbers([1, 2, 3]) # 3
find_greater_numbers([6, 1, 2, 7]) # 4
find_greater_numbers([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) # 0
find_greater_numbers([]) # 0
```
